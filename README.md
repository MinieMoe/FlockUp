Flock Up is a social networking web app that allows students to look for teamates to create project together so they could have something
to put on their resume. The goal is to help them stand out in the job market.

This is a quarter-long project, therefore, my team was not able to set up the database. We mostly focus on the front-end. I'm responsible to
make the front end of sign-up, sign-in, set up profile, user profile, and project profile page. All of the designs were made in Figma by a UX student 
that my CS team partnered with.
